# 27/27-hacker-news

This project is all about creating a web application that fetches and displays stories from the Hacker News API. (but functionalities will be limited, due to time constraints)

I will use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and for styling [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) with [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/). will use unofficial hacker news api [node-hnapi](https://github.com/cheeaun/node-hnapi/).

If you are interested, checkout [#28Days28Projects](https://github.com/kruzkasu223/28Days28Projects) for more projects like this.
